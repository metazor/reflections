When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository when collaborating with others or when
    working from multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I always pull manually, every pull represents one unit of logical change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a GitHub repository, which attributes the original
    repository. I'd use it when I want to clone a GitHub repository into my
    GitHub account.
    A clone is a copy of a local or remote repository. I'd use it when I want to
    copy a local or remote repository.
    A branch is an independent line of development. I'd use it to experiment
    with new features while keeping the main development branch unchanged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can see the latest changes and decide what to merge later. We can work
    offline as well.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I could sync the files in the cloud. The initial time to learn and set it up
    would be shorter, but it would quickly cause problems with collaborating.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
